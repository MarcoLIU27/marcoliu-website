- name: Video Analysis and Computer Vision for AI Interview System
  id: research1
  position: Capstone Project/Graduation Thesis
  description:
    - Built a video processing and analysis module into an AI interview system for CUHK that provides AI assessments of interviewees in terms of their facial/body behaviors, sentiments, tone of voice, and contents
    - Designed the architecture and workflow of the video module and integrated it into the system pipeline
    - Conducted face detection, recognition, and analysis using Microsoft Azure and different Python libraries/frameworks such as MediaPipe and FER, and subsequently processed and analyzed the raw data to obtain higher-level information
    - Designed video behavior evaluation criteria and implemented AI assessments in five domains (head, eyes, accessories, facial expressions, and hands/body)
    - Established rubrics for AI comments based on module testing results for real-world interview videos
    - Collaborated with back-end and front-end to ensure compatibility of the module with system requirements
