  description:
    - Worked in a group on deblurring and segmentation for cataract surgical instruments, in which a spatio-temporal
      RNN was proposed to tackle motion blurring and occlusion problems in cataract surgical instruments segmentation.
    - Designed and conducted experiments on model evaluation and comparison using TensorFlow, PyTorch and Docker.
    - Proposed ideas for the motivation of the project, designed and constructed the dataset, and improved the
      performance of the proposed networks.
    - Wrote weekly reports, submitted progress and final reports, and gave a video presentation to the faculty.
    - Worked on a paper as the second author which has been submitted to MICCAI 2022 and is under review.
