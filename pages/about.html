    Hi, I'm Marco Liu, a passionate and driven Computer Science master student at the University of California, San Diego. 
    With project and research experience in software development, AI, and machine learning, 
    I am constantly looking to expand my knowledge and skills in these fields.</br></br>
    As a creative and detail-oriented individual, 
    I take great pride in my work and have a proven track record of successful leadership in group projects. 
    I am committed to delivering high-quality results and am always eager to learn from my peers and mentors. 
    I have strong experience in Java, Python, C/C++, and JavaScript, 
    and have been actively involved in the full life-cycle of user-facing web software application 
    from requirement analysis, system design, product prototyping, to coding and testing. 
    What's more, I have research experience in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning.
