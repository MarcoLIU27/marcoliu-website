      Hi, I'm Marco Liu, a passionate and driven Computer Science Master‘s student at the University of California, San Diego.
      I have extensive project and research experience in software engineering, AI, and machine learning,
      and I’m also constantly looking to expand my knowledge and skills in these fields.</br></br>

      I am actively seeking a summer 2024 software engineer internship that will allow me to apply my technical skills,
      collaborate with a dynamic team, and contribute to projects that make a meaningful impact. </br></br>

      As a creative and detail-oriented individual, I take great pride in my work and have a proven track record of successful leadership in group projects.
      I am committed to delivering high-quality results and am always eager to learn from my peers and mentors.
      I have strong experience in Java, Python, C/C++, JavaScript, Spring Boot, and Node.js/Express,
      and have been actively involved in the full lifecycle of user-facing software development from requirement analysis, system design, and product prototyping to coding and testing.
      Also, I have worked as research intern in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning.
